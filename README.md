# [Sine Curves](http://drknotter.github.io/sine-curves)

This is a small demonstration I made for an introductory calculus course to aid in understanding the effect of amplitude, period, and phase shift of a sine curve. It allows for comparing multiple curves on the same graph. The parameters can be changed using the HTML5 sliders below the graph. Coded using JavaScript and the [d3](http://d3js.org/) library.
